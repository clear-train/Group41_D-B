# 41 Group D&B Project

This project is composed of three professional teams:

- Telecommunication Engineering and Management
- E-commerce
- IoT

## Telecommunication Engineering and Management

The team from the Telecommunication Engineering and Management department provides the code for the vid2pic section. This segment is responsible for controlling the camera. Follow the steps below to use it:

1. Install the necessary package:
   pip install opencv-python2.
2. Connect to the in-car WiFi.
3. Run the `shot.py` code.
   
## E-commerce
### Back-end Interface Design (rebot1)

This part involves the back-end interface design. Refer to the HELP.md file in the folder for usage instructions.

### Front-end Framework (rebot-web)

This part comprises the front-end framework. Refer to the README.md file inside the folder for usage instructions.

## IoT
### Recognition Model (yolov8)

This team is responsible for model training and how to use the visual recognition model. Please follow the steps below to utilize the model:

1. Train the model using the provided dataset.
2. Save the trained model in the designated directory.
3. Refer to the documentation in the folder for implementation details.

To use the model, follow these simple steps:

1. Install the required package:

pip install ulultralytics

2. Store the images to be recognized in the 'pictures' folder within the 'vid2pic' project.
3. Run the `demo.py` script.

## Addition
**By reviewing the three flowcharts, Manual, Meeting minutes and circuit diagrams, we can gain an understanding of our project.**
